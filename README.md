# Help Desk Ticket Tracker (Simulated)

This project includes sample tickets based on real troubleshooting steps I've personally taken or could confidently perform. 
It's meant to show how I approach problems, document steps, and follow through to resolution - skills I'm actively building as I prepare for the CompTIA A+ certification.

## Sample Tickets

| Ticket # | Issue | What I Tried | How I Fixed It | Time Spent |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| 006 | Laptop stuck on login screen | Opened Task Manager to check processes, restarted machine | Issue resolved after restart and cleanup of startup apps | 10 mins |
| 007 | User reports slow performance | Checked Task Manager for high CPU/memory usage, closed unnecessary background apps | System ran smoother after disabling startup programs | 15 mins |
| 008 | Wi-Fi not working at remote user’s home | Had user power cycle router, checked if other devices could connect | Wi-Fi restored after router reboot | 12 mins |
| 009 | New monitor not displaying | Verified cables were secure, changed display settings | Detected as second screen after switching input and extending desktop | 18 mins |
| 010 | OS corrupted and wouldn’t boot | Backed up files to USB, created Windows bootable drive | Reinstalled Windows and reinstalled drivers | 45 mins |
